        <h1>Overview of Web Development.</h1>
        <p id="para">Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network). Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services.
        There are two broad divisions of web development – front-end development (also called client-side development) and back-end development (also called server-side development).</p>
        <h2>Front-end</h2>
            <p id="para2">Front-end development refers to constructing what a user sees when they load a web application – the content, design and how you interact with it. This is done with three codes – HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
            HTML, short for Hyper Text Markup Language, is a special code for ‘marking up’ text in order to turn it into a web page. Every web page on the net is written in HTML, and it will form the backbone of any web application. CSS, short for Cascading Style Sheets, is a code for setting style rules for the appearance of web pages. CSS handles the cosmetic side of the web. Finally, JavaScript is a scripting language that’s widely used to add functionality and interactivity to web pages.
        </p>
        <h2>Back-end</h2>
        <p id="para3">
            Back-end development controls what goes on behind the scenes of a web application. A back-end often uses a database to generate the front-end.
            Back-end scripts are written in many different coding languages and frameworks, such as…
